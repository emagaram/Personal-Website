        <p>I built my largest project to date with Next.js: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" className="font-extrabold underline" href="https://www.stopspend.com/">StopSpend.com</a>,
            a full-stack web application using the Pages Router. Since then, I've transitioned to the App Router for newer projects.

            From working on StopSpend and other web apps, I'm proficient in Next.js's
            rendering strategies (SSG, SSR, ISR, and CSR), React Server Components, middleware, and optimization techniques to improve core web vitals. I use Vercel to deploy my Next.js projects and enjoy it's amazing developer experience.
