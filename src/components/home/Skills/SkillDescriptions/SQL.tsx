        <p>
            I work with SQL for database operations and have experience with both PostgreSQL and MySQL. I'm comfortable
            writing queries, joins, and basic database design, and I understand how to structure data and relationships
            for web applications. While I'm not a database expert, I can handle the SQL needed for most application
            development tasks.
