            <p>This website is built with Astro, which has become one of my favorite frameworks.
                I love that Astro ships zero JavaScript by default and maintains that zero-JS footprint
                even when you embed JavaScript frameworks like React for static rendering.
                This approach results in incredibly fast page loads and lets me send JavaScript to the client only when
                absolutely necessary. For content-driven websites, Astro is my go-to framework.
            </p>
