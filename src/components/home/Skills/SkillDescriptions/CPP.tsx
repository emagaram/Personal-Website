        <p>C++ was the first language I learned in college, and I was initially confused why my university would start us
            off with such a difficult language. But I quickly realized why—C++ deepened my understanding of data structures,
            memory management, and concurrency in ways that higher-level languages can't. Learning about pointers, manual
            memory allocation, and the intricacies of the standard library gave me a solid foundation for understanding how
            computers actually work under the hood.</p>
