        <p>Python is one of my core strengths. While it isn't statically typed, I forgive it because of how quickly I can
            develop with it. I use Python extensively for FastAPI and Django projects but my hardest challenge was optimizing
            a genetic algorithm for my <a rel="noopener noreferrer" className="font-extrabold underline" href="https://github.com/emagaram/genetic_multivar_16k">T9 keyboard solver</a>. Since Python isn't compiled, I had to benchmark and rewrite functions
            repeatedly to find the fastest implementation. That experience taught me a lot about Python performance optimization.</p>
