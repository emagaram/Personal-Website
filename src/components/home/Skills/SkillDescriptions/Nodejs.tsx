            serverless has taught me to keep bundle sizes small to minimize cold start times and optimize function performance.
            I'm comfortable building RESTful APIs, handling asynchronous operations, working with databases, and managing
            authentication flows. I built <a rel="noopener noreferrer" className="font-extrabold underline" href="https://www.stopspend.com/">StopSpend.com's</a> backend using Node.js.
