            This modal component and animation was built using React with the Motion library. I've been working with React since 2020, and it's become one of my core strengths.
            Some of the react libraries I've used are Next.js, React Query, and Zustand, along with UI
            libraries including Shadcn, Radix UI, and Material UI.

            One of my most challenging React projects was building a real-time collaboration editor
            similar to Google Docs. I integrated ProseMirror with Yjs to enable live multi-user
            editing and cursor tracking.
