            I work extensively with Figma for UI/UX design and prototyping. I enjoy the iterative design process—finding that
            perfect interface that minimizes clicks and reduces the learning curve for users.

            The most challenging design work
            I've done was for the StopSpend dashboard, which went through 75 iterations before I landed on a UI I was satisfied
            with. Throughout that process, I gathered feedback from friends and family to refine the experience. I'm comfortable
            with Figma's full feature set, including components, auto-layout, variants, and prototyping tools.</p>
