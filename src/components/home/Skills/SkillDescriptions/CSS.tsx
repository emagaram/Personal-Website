        <p>I'm proficient in CSS fundamentals like Flexbox, Grid, and animations as well as responsive design with media
            and container queries. I have substantial experience with SCSS for structured, maintainable stylesheets, and I primarily
            use Tailwind CSS for its utility-first approach and rapid development workflow. I understand when to reach for vanilla CSS,
            preprocessors, or utility frameworks based on project needs.</p>
